## About

A project and a thesis is a compilation of research that proves knowledge about the information learn throughout the master's program.

The point of the project is to show the ability to think critically about a topic and to knowledgeably discuss the information in-depth. Usually, the opportunity to expand upon a subject that is most relevant to some field can be taken such as, for instance, specialisation in a particular ML technique, a particular area, or a in-depth comparison.

## Identify Topic

### Method

* Investigate a topic that you wish to review, then formulate and review.
* Understand the philosophy and formulate the design, then address the ethical issues.
* Proced with data collection

## Topics
Common topics in Artificial Intelligence for a thesis, research, and project are:
* Deep Learning
* Robotics
* Natural Language Processing
* Reinforcement Learning
* Artificial Neural Network
* Expert Systems
* Fuzzy Systems
* Computer Vision
* Biometrics
* Computational Biology

### Deep Learning

Deep Learning is a subfield of Machine Learning that uses machine learning algorithms for data representation.

### Robotics

Robotics is a branch of the field which is a mixture of mechanical, electrical, and computer science engineering and uses machine learning algorithms for designing and working with robots.

### Natural Language Processing

It is a branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the way computer and human language interact with each other.

### Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning is a part of Artificial Intelligence that determines how an agent should act in an environment in order to maximize its performance.

### Artificial Neural Network

Artificial Neural Network imitates the working of a human brain. The nodes represent the biological neuron.

### Expert System

Expert System is a good area for research in artificial intelligence. Expert Systems solve complex computational problems.

### Fuzzy Systems

Fuzzy Systems produce a definite output for an indefinite input through fuzzy logic. Fuzzy Logic is a method of reasoning resembling human reasoning.

### Computer Vision

Computer Vision is a part of artificial intelligence that deals with making computers understand the digital images and videos.
