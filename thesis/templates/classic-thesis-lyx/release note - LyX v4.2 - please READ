classicthesis-v4.2 is a bugfix release of the classic thesis template that for the first time introduces BibLaTeX, a powerful package for formatting citations and references. Due to lacking support in LyX, several hacks have been applied (wiki.lyx.org/BibTeX/Biblatex) so that standard LyX dialogs could be used for citation input, and bibliography databases found during compilation. BibLaTeX is capable of employing several backends for bibliography management; we provide two: biber, the preferred and most capable one (but still immature and sometimes glitchy), and bibtex8. If both fail for you, revert to the old bibliography management with BibTeX.
Test the template by opening and compiling ClassicThesis.lyx in this order:
classicthesis-LyX-v4.2_biblatex_biber/ (tested and worked with TeX Live 2014 on Fedora Linux 22)
classicthesis-LyX-v4.2_biblatex_bibtex8/ (tested and worked with MikTeX 2.9 on Windows as well)
classicthesis-LyX-v4.1_bugfix/
Note that this is the same template set up in three different ways - you will be using only one of the folders.
